                <h2><strong>Platform Project</strong></h2>
                <p>The platform projects are our team&rsquo;s initiation project to mobile robotics. Using two robotic platforms the team has designed two different mobile robots and is actively adapting these robots to perform new tasks. Currently one platform is able to navigate a room using a revolving ultra-sonic sensor. The final goal for the platform is to be able to map the robots environment using the ultra-sonic sensor. Previous to this the platform was equipped with a thermal-sensor and would follow heat sources and locate the hottest spot in a room. Our other platform is currently used as a test platform for our IGVC sensors to help develop path planning algorithms.</p>
                <p>In the future, the team plans to integrate the platforms together to communicate as swarm robots. The goal being for both robots to communicate with one another to complete task together.</p>

                <h1><strong>Junior Projects</strong></h2>
                <p>Our team looks to promote robotics and mechatronics knowledge and experience to our younger members. We have developed a number of smaller scale projects to introduce our younger members to these areas and foster their development so that our team may continue and improve with each subsequent generation. Some of these projects include Bluetooth controlled robots, small Ardiuno projects and other electronic projects. Within the next few years it is our goal to have our junior team complete a battlebot robot!</p>

     <h2><strong><br><br><span class="spin">Pablo the Manipulator</span></strong></h2>


              
                <p><br />The Pablo project was our team&rsquo;s first venture into the design and creation of a manipulator robot. The project began as an experiment to see if our team could build a manipulator which would write out a team member&rsquo;s name with a marker. In a matter of days Paulo had been constructed and had surpassed the projects initial scope. Within a week of construction Paulo&rsquo;s character library allowed him to write entire sentences even executing advanced motion mechanics such as splines and dynamic calculations.</p>
